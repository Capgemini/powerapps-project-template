# Contributing

This generator is build using the framework provided by [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/), a tool build on a plugin architecture allowing anyone to build custom generators, just like this. Additionally, this is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

__There are a couple of ways you can contribute to this project, and all are welcome!__

## Package Anatomy
Firstly, how is this package structured? Well, all source code is within `src/` which contains two further directories. `common/` stores several utilities used across the generators, which is the next. `generators/` stores each of the generators with `app` being the default and the others callable via `@capgemini/csdpackage:[directory]`. 

Each generator will contain an `index.ts` file which exports a class extending `Generator`. Optionally any other files and directories can be created to support that generator - like any NodeJS script, it can import whatever it needs but this file orchestrates the process. By convention, all our generators have a `templates/` directory containing the raw files to be copied/merged to the target directory.

At this point, things get a little complicated... if you need to know more check out the docs provided by yeoman [here](https://yeoman.io/authoring/index.html).

## "Source" code change
For a simple change of the "raw" files that make up the generated package, check out `templates/` of the generator you'd like to edit - probably `app` (`./src/generators/app/templates`). 

Although simple, this is where much of the power of this generator lies. Be it updating npm/nuget dependency versions or adding to the code analysers - these are all config which is simply lifted and shifted for __NEW projects__. I'll remind you again, this generator can't update existing packages. 

An easy way to contribute would be to apply any config changes you make to a project-specific package to the template(s) of this, assuming  they add value for a future project.

> These changes are often simple enough to be made via Azure DevOps online editors to save you even cloning the project. ðŸ˜€

## Generating process change
If you'd like to make a change to package in terms of the tasks to carries out (such as configuring Azure DevOps) then you'll need to understand a little more regarding how the generators are executed. At the end of the day though, these are just NodeJS scripts executing which you can hopefully follow.
